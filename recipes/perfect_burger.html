    <h4>The perfect burger with veggies, meat patty and sauce</h4>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.</li>
        <li>Whisk egg, salt, and pepper together in a medium bowl.</li>
        <li>Add ground beef and bread crumbs; mix with your hands or a fork until well blended.</li>
        <li>Form into four 3/4-inch-thick patties.</li>
        <li>Place patties on the preheated grill. Cover and cook 6 to 8 minutes per side, or to desired doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
