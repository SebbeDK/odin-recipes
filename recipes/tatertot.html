    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol style="border-style: double;">
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly coat a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Spread potato tots on a large baking sheet into an even layer.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden and crispy, about 35 minutes. Remove from oven and set aside. Reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>While potato tots cook, whisk together cream of chicken soup, sour cream, ranch dressing, ranch dressing mix, black pepper, and granulated garlic in a large bowl until thoroughly combined. Fold in chicken, Cheddar, and 1 cup of the cooked bacon until fully coated in sour cream mixture.</li>
        <li>Transfer chicken mixture to prepared baking dish and spread it into an even layer. Top evenly with cooked potato tots. Bake in preheated oven until bubbling around edges, 30 to 35 minutes.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle evenly with remaining 1/4 cup cooked bacon; garnish with scallions.</li>
